## Machine Learning Algorithm with Linear Regression Model

### Project Description

- This project implemented various concepts such as EDA, Correlation, Multicollinearity, etc.
- This application is made up of a simple machine learning algorithm(`Linear Regression`) from the sklearn library. 

### Dataset Description

- Dataset link: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fmendes/fmendesdat263xdemos)
- Observations: 15000 
- Features: 8

### Data Dictionary
						
- User_ID: The ID of the person, which is unique
- Gender: Gender of the person
- Age: Age of the person
- Height: Height of the person in cm
- Weight: Weight of the person in kg
- Duration: Duration of the person's exercise/activity
- Heart_Rate: Heart rate per minute of the person
- Body_Temp: A body temperature of the person in Celsius
- Calories: Calories burned in kilocalories


### Running Streamlit File

After downloading and saving the streamlit file (`app.py`) into a certain directory, you have to open the `Command Prompt`.In your command prompt, change the directory to the directory where the streamlit file is saved and then type:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

After a couple of seconds, the WebApp pops up in your browser, and then you can modify it with your preferred Interpreter. For saving changes on the WebApp and Streamlit file, you have to press `Ctrl + S` while you are in your interpreter.
